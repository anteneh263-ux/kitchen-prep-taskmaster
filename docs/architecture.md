# Architecture — Kitchen Prep Taskmaster

## The rule that shapes the whole system

**Gemini provides judgment. Deterministic Python owns every number.**

The scheduled production pipeline calls Gemini exactly twice per run through the
Google Gen AI SDK, at two controlled, schema-bounded points. Neither call is
allowed to become the source of an authoritative quantity. The optional ADK
developer adapter is a separate interactive entry point and is not used by
Cloud Scheduler.

| Gemini may | Gemini may never |
| --- | --- |
| Propose a per-dish demand forecast, with drivers and reasoning | Have that proposal used unvalidated — every field is checked, and a rejected forecast is replaced by a deterministic baseline |
| Prioritise prep tasks and explain the day | Compute ingredient requirements, FEFO consumption, shortfalls or order quantities |
| Write the morning summary, warnings and recommended actions | Emit the published document directly — Python renders Markdown from validated JSON |
| Flag that something needs a human decision | Approve a menu or portion change itself |

Every value that a cook or a supplier acts on — `ingredient_requirements`,
`fefo_consumption`, `prep_shortfalls`, `replenishment_orders`, `waste_flagged`,
`remaining_stock` — is produced by deterministic Python and handed to Gemini
**read-only**.

## Where the boundary is enforced in code

| Boundary | Enforced by |
| --- | --- |
| Production model calls are limited to two schema-bounded operations | `kitchen_prep/gemini/client.py` — Google Gen AI SDK calls only `propose_forecast` and `propose_briefing` |
| The optional ADK adapter exposes only one tool | `kitchen_prep/agent.py` — `tools=[run_daily_prep]`; it is not in the scheduled production path |
| A proposed forecast cannot enter the pipeline unchecked | `kitchen_prep/pipeline/forecast_validate.py` raises `ForecastRejected`; the orchestrator substitutes `baseline_forecast()` |
| The model cannot silently break the run | `kitchen_prep/gemini/client.py` — only 408/429/5xx/network map to `GeminiUnavailable`; 400/401/403/404 crash rather than degrade quietly |
| The briefing cannot change the plan's shape | `kitchen_prep/contracts.py` — `validate_briefing()` |
| The published document is not raw model output | `kitchen_prep/render/markdown.py` renders Markdown from validated JSON |
| A retried trigger cannot create a second plan | `plan_exists()` check plus create-only write of `daily_plans/{date}` |
| A failed run is still auditable | `append_run_log()` in the orchestrator's `finally` block |

### Storage status, stated precisely

`daily_plans`, `run_logs` and `inventory_snapshots` are written through either
backend (`LocalJsonStore` for local development, `FirestoreStore` when
`KP_STORE=firestore`). The first inventory date starts from the synthetic seed.
For each later date the store freezes the latest earlier output as that date's
input. Forced reruns reuse the frozen input rather than the prior output, making
replay safe and preventing double consumption. Purchase orders remain proposed
actions; stock changes only through consumption until an explicit receiving
integration is added.

## Request flow, end to end

1. **07:00 Europe/Oslo** — Cloud Scheduler fires `kitchen-prep-daily` and POSTs
   `{}` to `<service-url>/runs/daily` with an OIDC token whose audience is the
   service URL. Cloud Run runs `--no-allow-unauthenticated`, so only the invoker
   service account gets through.
2. **Idempotency check** — the orchestrator resolves the run date server-side in
   Europe/Oslo and returns the existing plan if `daily_plans/{date}` already
   exists. Scheduler retries are therefore side-effect free.
3. **Inputs** — expected covers from bookings; weather from Open-Meteo, or the
   deterministic offline stub when no API key is configured.
4. **Gemini step 1 via Google Gen AI SDK** — a demand forecast is proposed, then validated. Anything
   outside the contract falls back to the same-weekday baseline, and the plan
   records which path was taken in `forecast_source`.
5. **Deterministic core** — recipe explosion, FEFO consumption of today's
   requirements, prep shortfalls, prep task ordering, then replenishment to par
   from what is genuinely left.
6. **Gemini step 2 via Google Gen AI SDK** — the frozen plan is handed to the model, which returns a
   prioritisation and briefing in a fixed JSON shape. Invalid or unavailable
   output falls back to a deterministic briefing built from the same plan.
7. **Publish** — Python renders Markdown, the plan is stored, and the run log is
   appended whether the run succeeded or failed.
8. **Consumption** — the kitchen opens `GET /` on a phone; other systems read
   `GET /plans/latest`.

## Data note

All restaurant names, menu data, recipes, sales history, bookings and inventory
values in this repository are **synthetic and generic**. No real restaurant,
supplier or customer data is used anywhere in the project.
